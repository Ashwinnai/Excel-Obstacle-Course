Home of the Excel Obstacle Course, the easiest ways to build muscle memory for Excel Shortcuts!

NOTE: if you have issues with Excel restricting macros (the timer is macro based), you will need to right click on the file, go to properties and check "Unblock"

When I was training Excel hotkeys to new employees, I tried to instill the benefit of using hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) and minimizing the touchpad / mouse.
  Originally, I gave them a printout with all the shortcuts printed on it (CNTL C, CNTL V, etc.). When I revisited their desks I noticed that the sheet was
  hanging in their cube, but they weren't using the hotkeys. This gave me an idea...
  
Thinking back to my youth, I thought of the game "Street Fighter 2" and how I memorized all the special moves for every character. Originally I had referenced
  the guide in Nintendo Power before I was able to instill the muscle memory to my fingers. Why couldn't we apply the same principle to Excel? The Excel
  Obstacle Course was born!
  
Spending 15 minutes a day, new hires competed to get the fastest completion time to the Excel Obstacle Course, while subliminally programming hotkey muscle memory to
  their fingers that would help them become the top Excel users on the floor.
  
Whether you are a new hire right out of college with zero Excel experience, a data processor who is looking to speed up their output, or a VP who wants to fly
  through spreadsheets with the greatest of ease-- the Excel Obstacle Course is the most fun and easy way to ramp up your skills and make yourself stand out from
  the crowd!
